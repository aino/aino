It serves as a platform for craftsmanship, community, and curiosity.</p><p>The jewellery collection is a gathering of iterated designs with equal hierarchy in wearability and expression. Products are seen as a collective system of emotional tools for the everyday.</p><p>All Blues believe in the power of small scale and responsible production methods. Using only recycled precious metals, all items are handmade by local artisans at a third-generation foundry outside of Stockholm.</p></div>"
